=================================================================================================================
Release V2.0
--------------------------------------------------
- VSync on/off
- Statistics are not yet translated (possible?)
- Determine a way to detect that de GpuProgram was loaded and compiled !!!!!
- Beter resource management. Use 'projects'. Configuration per project (i.e. resource directories) is possible. Also store the positions of the components
  for each particle system.
- New meshes picklist, with the meshes themselves displayed.
- Dynamic attribute property: Visual dialog on which control points can be added.
- Group components together into 'templates'. This is comparable to the aliasses in a script. The templates/aliasses can be defined in 
  the editor and dragged into the canvas of the editor (where all properties can be tuned again).
- Renderer Property Window: Define "Texture coords set" by means of texture frame where the rectangle is presented visually 
  and can be selected by means of the mouse.
- Tool: Performance analyser to determine appropriate quota; present overview and apply dynamically.
- Tool: Analyser to determine the distribution of particles in the spatial hashing cells (in case the spatial hashtable is used).
- Tool: Analyse FPS.
- Tool: Create atlas texture.
- Tool: Deployer, which exports all materials, scripts, textures, etc. to target directories, which can be configured per project.
- Tool: Create online or offline mesh from a text (using FTGL). This mesh is used as a Vertex emitter. See also
  http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=27982&highlight=
- Renderer Property Window: If "Use soft particles" is set to false, the contrast power, scale and delta attributes must be hidden. This
  applies to more settings.
- Some connections are possible with the editor, but not with the plugin. For instance, exclude an emitter (in an Affector) that 
  is part of another technique.
- Implement: PhysXActorExternPropertyWindow
- Dropdownlistbox with selection of skyboxes.
- ParticleUniverseRendererPropertyWindow: Implement Texture coords set
- Static linking of both Ogre and the PU plugin
- All particle dimensions versus individual particle width, height and depth => disable properties, they are mutual exclusive.
- Implement 'SceneDecorator'
- Keys left, right, up, down to move the particle system in the render window.
- CTRL-F for searching a text in the script.
- If the application is quit, display a message if the particle system has been changed, but not been saved
- Add logo to the 'About' dialog box.
- Collapse all option to quickly collapse the property window.
- Tooltip for all properties (with text from the manual).
- Add refresh button in the Edit tab toolbox. This recreates a complete new particle system from the script. This is sometimes needed in
  case an attribute is not changed in realtime (i.e. emitted techniques).
- Move mMainSceneNode->attachObject(mCurrentParticleSystemForRenderer); from OnPlay to CreateNewSystem. Same for OgreControlComponent.
- Don't disable the play icons when the script tab is selected, but if play (F6) is selected, open the 'render' tab.
- After clicking a component, set the same colour in the header of the property window, so it is clear which type
  of component is selected based on the colour. Also set the component type for colourblind people.
- Add a (*) to the particle system in the list indicating it has been changed
- Display runtime statistics other than FPS, number of particles: This means memory consumption over time.
- Change order play icons.

 :arrow: Editor: Support dds format in displaying textures (needs dds support in wxWidgets).
 :arrow: Editor: New material picklist with images of the materials.
 :arrow: Editor: Split window for edit tab (split between edit and render part).
- For better mousepicking of the rotation gizmo, take the surrounding pixels into account (nice to have).
- Nice to have: Allocated memory
- Nice to have: Add box/panels in 'movement' gizmo for free-format move.
- Nice to have: When zooming in in ortho, the course grid has think lines. Irritating when the camera rotates.
- Nice to have: Disable grid does not work in perpendicular ortho mode.

=================================================================================================================
Release V1.5.1:
--------------------------------------------------
:arrow: Editor: Multi-language support.

=================================================================================================================
Release V1.5
--------------------------------------------------
:arrow: Editor: Object (mesh, particle system) manipulation by means of move, rotate and scale gizmo's that work in both world- and object space, 
 similar to packages like Unity 3D, Max 3D, etc.
:arrow: Editor: Object rotation by entering Euler angles.
:arrow: Editor: Importing (skinned) meshes by means of drag and drop from the file explorer to the Particle Universe Editor; this automatically
 opens a directory dialog to select the location(s) of dependent resources (skeleton files, materials, textures, ...).
:arrow: Editor: Select a bone from a skeleton and attach a particle system to it. Meshes with animation can be played (including the attached 
 particle system). Particle systems can be oriented relative to the bone by means of the gizmo.
:arrow: Editor: Orthogonal and Perspective camera views. The orthogonal camera view includes options to view from a perpendicular or 45 degree 
 angle view. Orientation is done by a ortho camera gizmo. The perspective camera view has a free rotating camera.

 
=================================================================================================================
Release V1.4

 :arrow: Editor: Update documentation ([color=#FF0000]0 %[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Replace wxListbox with particle systems with wxTreeCtrl, to categorize them ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).

 :arrow: Editor: The toolbar in the edit window has become a floating toolbar and does not scroll anymore when the window scrolls ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
