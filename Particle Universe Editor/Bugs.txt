Known bugs:
==========
- Sometimes the particle list is displayed in full length in the Edit tab overwriting the component property window.
- Deleting renderer from technique in Edittab and switching to another tab results in a crash.
- Editor can't load script with Chinese character. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=447
- See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=444&p=1398#p1398
- Changes in emitted techniques or its subcomponents do not come into effect in realtime, if the graphical editor (EditTab) is used (maybe
  add 'compile' support to re-create the particle system completely)
- Adding a resource location and exit the application results in memory leaks. Check for duplicates.
- CTRL/S saves PU script when material tab is open. This is confusing.
- After inserting a new material at the top and swapping tabs, the new material is listed at the bottom.
- With synchronisation between render/edit tabs, the particle system scale is incorrect in the edit tab (= old bug?). It is restored 
  when selecting new ps and selecting the old one again.
- DynamicAttribute Curved dialog: Flickering when controlpoints are moved.

V1.5.1
======
 :arrow: Editor: Refresh screen after disconnecting 2 components in the Edit-tab. The connection line is immediately removed.
 :arrow: Editor: notifyTimeRescaled changes scaleTime in the particle system. This conflicts if you actually want to change the scaleTime value.
 :arrow: Editor: Solved irritating flashing of the screen after selecting another particle system from the list.
 :arrow: Editor: Crash when changing texture coordinates in emitter while the particle system is running.


V1.5
=====
 :arrow: Editor: Crash when texture coordinates in Texture Animator is set to values higher than values defined in the renderer ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Crash when mesh name is not filled and you select an Entity Renderer ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Crash when renderer is deleted in Edittab while the particle system is running ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).

V1.4
=====
 :arrow: Editor: 'Options' screen disappears when displayed on top of the edittab and the edittab is pressed ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Problem reading added resource locations with space character. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=455 ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Set texture coordinate in emitter with value > 0 while there is only 1 row and 1 column causes a crash. No validation added to the plugin itself (performance), but because of a change in ParticleRenderer::getNumTextureCoords(), the editor at least performs the validation ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Inconsistency between render, edit and scrip tab. See http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=444&p=1398#p1398. Changing the name of the particle system in the Edit-tab doesn't result in a changed name in the list and the script. This is because once created, the particle system cannot be renamed (it is a Movable object) ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Change made in script (name) is not automatically refreshed in the listbox when the Compile is done ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).
 :arrow: Editor: Change system name in script + compile doesn't change the name in the list, but creates a CopyOf... ([color=#00BF00]DONE[/color]).


V 1.3.1
=======
Bugs:
- (DONE) After selecting a script in the listbox, the listbox gives a flickering, which is annoying.
- (DONE) ForceFieldAffector: Change type from realtime to matrix and then change the forcefield size (from 64 to 32) crashes the application. Changing
  it by means of the script works, but not in the edit tab. First changing the forcefield size from 64 to 32 and then changing the type from 
  realtime to matrix does work.



V 1.3
=====
Bugs:
- (DONE) The preview of the particle system in the 'Edit' tab is not visible anymore


V 1.2
=====
Bugs:
- (DONE) Render to image files with background colour fixed (background colour was always black).
- (DONE) Bug scenario: http://www.fxpression.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=284. This particular script doesn't cause a bug anymore.
- (DONE) GeometryRotator: Change type of rotation speed a couple of times in the script, results in a crash (this occurs in combination with
  changing the DynamicAttributeType and an EntityRenderer). Hard to find what it is, because even the debugger exits.
  Seems solved with the new scriptcompiler.
