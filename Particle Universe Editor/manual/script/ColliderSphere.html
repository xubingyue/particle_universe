  <h2 id="content">Sphere Collider</h2>
  <p>The Sphere Collider represents a sphere shape with which the particles collide. This concerns particles of the same technique at which the Sphere 
     Collider is registered. If a particle collides with the shape, the collision flag is set, which makes it possible to observe the particle collision. Furthermore,
	 the Collider itself can change the behaviour of the particle. This concerns behaviour that is difficult to realise (or with a lot of overhead) in an event
	 handler, because the data will not be available in the event handler. Bouncing and flowing (in which the particle flows on the surface of the shape) are typical examples. </p>
     
  <p>Beware that the Sphere Collider is part of Particle Universe itself. If you want more sophisticated collision and responses, Particle Universe also has the option to integrate with NvidiaÂ´s PhysX engine, formerly owned by Ageia.</p>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Syntax:
  <br>
  <p><strong><i>affector&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SphereCollider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[affectorName]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{affector properties}</i></strong>
  <p>See ParticleAffector for explanation of the syntax.</p>
  <p> Example:
  <pre>
affector                     SphereCollider
{
    position                 0 400 0
    radius                   300
    intersection             point
    collision_type           bounce
    friction                 0.2
    bouncyness               0.4
}</pre>
  <h3>Properties</h3>
  <br>

  <h6>Friction</h6>
  <p>Friction is an attribute of the sphere surface. It indicates the smoothness of the surface, which will influence the rotation behaviour of the particle
     when it hits the sphere. If the friction is high, the particle rotation (both texture and geometry rotation) decreases. Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>friction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#value</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>friction</i></strong> is the keyword. <font color="#F62217"><strong><em>collision_friction</em></strong><em> is deprecated from version 1.2</em></font>
    <br><strong><i>#value</i></strong> is a real value > 0 that defines the friction. Default: 0.0.</p>

  <h6>Bouncyness</h6>
  <p>Bouncyness is an attribute of the surface. It indicates how much a particle bounces from the sphere when it hits the surface. This means that
     bouncyness influences the particle velocity. Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>bouncyness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#value</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>bouncyness</i></strong> is the keyword. <font color="#F62217"><strong><em>collision_bouncyness</em></strong><em> is deprecated from version 1.2</em></font>
    <br><strong><i>#value</i></strong> is a real value between > 0 that defines the bouncyness. The higher the value, the higher the velocity of a particle
	when it hits the sphere. Default: 1.0.</p>

  <h6>Intersection Type</h6>
  <p>Determines how a particle collision should be determined. 'point' means that the position of a particle will be validated against the Colliders' 
     shape, while 'box' means that the dimensions (width, height and depth) are taken into account to determine whether the particle collides. Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>intersection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point | box</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>intersection</i></strong> is the keyword. <font color="#F62217"><strong><em>collision_intersection</em></strong><em> is deprecated from version 1.2</em></font>
    <br><strong><i>point</i></strong> defines whether the position of the particle is used to determine collision. Default: point.
    <br><strong><i>box</i></strong> defines whether the particle width, height and depth are used to determine collision.</p>

  <h6>Collision Type</h6>
  <p>Determines how a particle behaves after collision with this collider. The behaviour of the particle is solved in the collider and only
     behaviour that needs the colliders' data, is taken into account. The fact that a particle expires for example, can be achieved by using an 
     Observer in combination with an EventHandler (DoExpireEventHandler). Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>collision_type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounce | flow | none</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>collision_type</i></strong> is the keyword.
    <br><strong><i>bounce</i></strong> means that the particle bounces off the collider. Default: bounce.
    <br><strong><i>flow</i></strong> means that the particle flows around the contours of the collider.
    <br><strong><i>none</i></strong> means that the particle doesn't do anything. This value should be set 
	if the behaviour of the particle is determined outside the collider (for example, expiring the particle).</p>

  <h6>Radius</h6>
  <p>Represents the radius of the sphere. Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>radius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#value</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>radius</i></strong> is the keyword. <font color="#F62217"><strong><em>sphere_collider_radius</em></strong><em> is deprecated from version 1.2</em></font>
    <br>
    <strong><i>#value</i></strong> is a real value > 0 that defines the radius of the sphere. Default: 0.0.</p>

  <h6>Inner Collision</h6>
  <p>Defines whether the collision takes place inside of the sphere, or outside. If the value is set to true, particles collide with the inner surface of the sphere. Syntax:</p>
  <p><strong><i>inner_collision&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true | false</i></strong>
    <br>
    <br><strong><i>inner_collision</i></strong> is the keyword.
  <br>
  <strong><i>true | false</i></strong> defines wither the collision is inside of the sphere. Default: false.</p>
